1. How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
Ans : We compare two JSON objects by converting them to string using JSON.stringify.
      but if the JSON objects have same properties but in different order. The equality check would fail in this case.
      To compare two JSON objects and ensure equality, Lodashâ€™s .isEqual() is used.
